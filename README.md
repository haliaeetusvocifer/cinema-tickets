This is my answer to the exercise, based on [this requirement](./requirement.md).
The principles are the same (Test Driven Development, mockup, clean code etc). 


- Prerequesites
  Node.JS (latest will do. I am using 22.10.0)

- To install all the libraries:
`npm install`


- To run the tests:
`npm test`

- To have a play with the console demo of the main object under test:
 `node index`

Libraries and things used:
- jest
- jest extended
- prettier
- eslint
- mocha
- inquirer/prompt (for the demo code)
